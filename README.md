# CLI Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI

A Python-based command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game with **two game modes**:  
- Human vs Human  
- Human vs AI (powered by an **unbeatable Minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning)

The AI always makes the optimal move, so you can’t beat it — at best, you can force a draw.
